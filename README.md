# Algorithms_Python
I am dumping all my algorithm problems in this repository.
My ultimate aim is to do ML, DL and AI.
So to achieve those coding is required. To make my coding strong I have decided to learn all the algorithms.
Hope this helps everyone with same passion. 

And please note that I am working on my own. I am not forking any Repos or copying them. This is solely my work.

## Linear Search:
A simple approach is to do a linear search, i.e  

Start from the leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare x with each element of arr[]
If x matches with an element, return the index.
If x doesnâ€™t match with any of elements, print that the element is not found. 
The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(n). 

Linear search is rarely used practically because other search algorithms such as the binary search algorithm and hash tables allow significantly faster-searching comparison to Linear search.

### Improve Linear Search Worst-Case Complexity

if element Found at last  O(n) to O(1)
if element Not found O(n) to O(n/2)
